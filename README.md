# Employee Attrition & Layoff Prediction

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/manohar6317/Attrition_Layoff_Prediction/blob/main/Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.ipynb)

This repository contains a project focused on predicting employee attrition (voluntary departures) and potential layoffs (involuntary departures) within an organization. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and provide insights that can help organizations proactively address these issues.

## Overview

* **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading relevant employee data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize key relationships.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of the prediction models. This might involve handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, or creating interaction terms.
* **Model Building and Training:** Implementing and training various machine learning models suitable for binary classification tasks (predicting whether an employee will leave or stay, or whether a layoff is likely). Common models include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
* **Interpretation and Insights:** Analyzing the model results to identify the most important factors influencing attrition and potential layoffs.

## Repository Contents

* **`Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.ipynb`:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the attrition and layoff prediction project. This includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
* **`README.md`:** This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for understanding and potentially running the code.
* **`/data` (Optional):** This directory might contain the dataset(s) used for training and testing the models. If the data is sensitive or proprietary, it might not be included in the repository and instructions on how to obtain or use it would be provided here.
* **`/models` (Optional):** This directory could store any saved trained models for later use or deployment.
* **`/reports` (Optional):** This directory might contain reports or visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Getting Started

To run and explore this project, you will need to have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Jupyter Notebook**  
* **Required Python Libraries:** You can install the necessary libraries using pip. It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

    You might need to install additional libraries depending on the specific models and techniques used in the notebook. Check the import statements at the beginning of the `Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.ipynb` file for a complete list.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/manohar6317/Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/manohar6317/Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.git)
    cd Attrition_Layoff_Prediction
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

3.  **Run the notebook cells:** Open the `Attrition_Layoff_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to understand the data processing, model building, and evaluation steps.

4.  **Explore the results:** Analyze the output of the notebook to understand the model's predictions and the insights derived from the analysis.

## Potential Improvements and Future Work

* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Further investigate and visualize the importance of different features in predicting attrition and layoffs.
* **Advanced Modeling Techniques:** Explore more sophisticated machine learning models, such as deep learning algorithms, to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implement techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen models.
* **Deployment:** Consider how the trained model could be deployed for real-time prediction and integration into HR systems.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Implement methods to make the model predictions more interpretable and understandable for stakeholders.
* **Handling Imbalanced Data:** If the dataset has an imbalanced distribution of attrition/layoff cases, explore techniques to address this issue (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, cost-sensitive learning).
* **Incorporating External Factors:** Explore the possibility of incorporating external economic or industry-specific data that might influence attrition and layoffs.
